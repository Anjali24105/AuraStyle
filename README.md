# 👗 AuraStyle : Multimodal E-Commerce Fashion & Text-to-Image Trend Matcher

AuraStyle is an AI-powered fashion search application that enables users to discover fashion products using natural language descriptions, uploaded images, or both simultaneously. The project leverages OpenAI's CLIP model to understand the semantic relationship between text and images, providing intelligent and visually relevant product recommendations.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user enters a text query or uploads a fashion image.
2. The CLIP model generates embedding vectors.
3. Product embeddings stored in MongoDB are compared using cosine similarity.
4. The Top 10 most relevant fashion products are retrieved.
5. Results are displayed through the Flask web interface.
